# Topic: Basics of Working with Mouse. GDI Primitives. Bezier Curve.
## Intro
### Purpose
* Event-driven programming (message-oriented)
* API
* Windows applications development

### Additional Purposes
* Version Control Systems (GIT)
* Programming Style Guidelines
* Debugging
* Testing

## Completed Mandatory Objectives
* Draw few lines of different colors and weights
* Draw a Bezier curve
* Draw few plane objects (ex. circle, square, pie, polygon...) of different colors, weights, filled and not
* Draw 2 different objects using mouse

## Completed Objectives With Points
* Add a switch (button, select list...) that will change mouse ability to draw objects (2 pt)
* Draw a Bezier curve using mouse (1 pt)
* Fill an object with a gradient (1 pt)
* Delete objects using mouse clicking (2 pt)
* Zoom in and out application working area using keyboard (2 pt)

## Description

* 1. Application supports 2 mouse abilities to draw objects (Clicks / Drag and Drop).
* 2. To delete objects, right click on the object you want to delete. For Bezier curves try to focus between the position points (1 and 3).
* 3. Alternatively, mouse right button click features cancelling. It will cancel the drawing of a figure and zooming.
* 4. In order to zoom in - press the ENTER key once, then with the arrow keys select the figure you want to zoom in and press ENTER. To zoom out - press the ENTER key.
