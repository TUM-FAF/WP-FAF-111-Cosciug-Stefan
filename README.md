## Description of special symbols used in code comments
* ' ' - For code syntax elements.
* " " - For other information that need to be highlighted. May be "Caption of buttons", "Applied methods", or any other keywords related to the code.
* { } - For enumeration of possible values of a variable, and their description.

## Line spacing
* 5 lines - Separates the main parts of a program (global declarations & function prototypes, main function, other functions).
* 2 lines - Separates a main block title comment from the code.
* 1 line - Regular separator. Delimits "cases" in 'switch' function and blocks of code with different purpose.
